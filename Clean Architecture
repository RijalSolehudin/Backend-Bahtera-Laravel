✅ Clean Architecture Implementation Complete
Controllers Refactored
InvitationController: Now uses InvitationService and returns InvitationResource
GuestController: Uses GuestService and returns GuestResource
RSVPController: Uses RSVPService and returns RSVPResource
WishController: Uses WishService and returns WishResource

Separation of Concerns Achieved
Form Requests: Centralized validation in StoreInvitationRequest, UpdateInvitationRequest, StoreGuestRequest, UpdateGuestRequest, StoreRSVPRequest, StoreWishRequest
API Resources: Standardized JSON responses with InvitationResource, GuestResource, RSVPResource, WishResource
Service Classes: Business logic encapsulated in InvitationService, GuestService, RSVPService, WishService

✅ Key Improvements
Dependency Injection: Controllers now inject services via constructor
Validation: Moved from inline validation to dedicated Form Request classes
Response Formatting: Consistent API responses using Resource classes
Business Logic: Separated into Service layer for better testability and maintainability
Route Conflict Resolution: Fixed public/authenticated route conflicts


✅Test Updates
Updated all test assertions to expect {"data": {...}} structure from API Resources
Fixed route URLs (public show now uses /api/public/invitations/{slug})
Resolved circular reference issue in Resources
Test Results: 22/22 tests passing ✅
The codebase now follows Laravel best practices with proper Clean Architecture principles, making it more maintainable, testable, and scalable for future development.
